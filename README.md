#### **API Integration**
This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data:
- **Current Weather API:**  
  `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={City}&appid={ApiKey}&units=metric`
- **Forecast API:**  
  `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={City}&appid={ApiKey}`

---

#### **Configuration**
Replace the placeholder API key in the `fetchWeather` function with your OpenWeatherMap API key:
```javascript
const ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

---

#### **Customization**
- **Styling:** Update `App.css` for custom styles.
- **Forecast Display:** Modify the `WeatherForecast` component in `/components/forecast.js` to change how forecast data is presented.

---

#### **Error Handling**
If an invalid city name is entered or the API fails:
- An error message is displayed: `"City not found"` or another relevant error message.

---

#### **Future Improvements**
- Add geolocation support for fetching weather based on user location.
- Enhance the UI with more animations and responsive design.
- Include additional weather metrics like sunrise, sunset, and air quality.

---

#### **Dependencies**
- React.js
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Fetch API (built into modern browsers)
